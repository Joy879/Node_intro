* Define Monolithic architecture


A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. 
It is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.  To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.


* Explain microservices in your own understanding

As opposed to monolith architecture microservices consist of independent deployable services that can each be tested and scaled individually.

* Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

Microservice architecture is more appealing because it aligns with DevOps and continous delivery 


* Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?

Nodejs is multithreaded but runs js code in single thread


* What does REPL stand for?

A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive environment to explore tools available in specific environments or programming languages.


* Create a javascript file and inside the file add code that will log in to the console, your name, your preferred programming language, and where you see yourself in the next 1 year.
